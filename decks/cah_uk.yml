# Once entries have been added and are in use they shouldn't be changed or
# re-ordered, because the bot is only storing indices into the Black and White
# arrays.
#
# If you need to change the deck in use or add more cards then at the moment
# the best way is to create a new deck file.

# Five or more underscores (_____) denote placeholder text. Maximum two per
# text.
# End these with the correct punctuation.
Black:
    - How did I lose my virginity?
    - Why can't I sleep at night?
    - What's that smell?
    - I got 99 problems but _____ ain't one.
    - Maybe she's born with it. Maybe it's _____.
    # Black Cards with multiple lines are rare, but they do exist. You'll need
    # to double quote these and use newlines:
    - "Step 1: _____.\nStep 2: _____.\nStep 3: Profit."

# Start with a lower case letter unless the word is always capitalised (e.g.
# proper noun). End with no punctuation unless required by the text.
